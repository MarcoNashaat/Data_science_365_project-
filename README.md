# Regression Analysis Project
This repository contains files and analysis for a regression project offered by DataScience-365. The project covers five stages of analysis, starting from simple correlation to building a predictive model. Each stage demonstrates different statistical and analytical techniques applied to a given dataset.

## Contents
1. Regression Analysis Dataset-Start.xlsx: Contains the raw data at the beginning of the project.
2. Regression Analysis Dataset-End.xlsx: Includes all analysis completed, from correlation to predictive modeling.

## Analysis Stages
1. Correlation Analysis
Explores relationships between variables to identify potential predictors for regression modeling.

2. Simple Linear Regression
Builds a basic linear regression model to understand the effect of a single predictor variable on the target variable.

3. Multiple Linear Regression
Expands the model to include multiple predictor variables to improve prediction accuracy and capture more complex relationships.

4. Advanced Multiple Linear Regression
Refines the model by adding transformations, interaction terms, or polynomial terms to better fit the data.

5. Predictive Modeling and Next Steps
Finalizes the model and evaluates its performance. Discusses potential improvements, alternative modeling approaches, or next steps for further analysis.

## Getting Started
1. Download both Excel files.
2. Use Regression Analysis Dataset-Start.xlsx to practice each stage of analysis independently.
3. Refer to Regression Analysis Dataset-End.xlsx for solutions and guidance on each task.
